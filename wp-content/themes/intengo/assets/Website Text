Prediction Markets for Product Screening

Create Stronger Concepts... Faster

	Challenge with Most Screening:	Solution with Intengo:

Speed to market
Concept screening takes too long

Are you winning or losing the battle to market? If concept screening is bogging you down, you have a lot to lose—from development time and dollars, to opportunity costs, to (oh, yes) your sanity.
Streamline your execution and beat your competitors to market

We ask, why walk when you can run? With our patented approach, you can learn where to invest your money in as little as seven days. Your results are as accurate as traditional screening with greater differentiation.

Broader
test set
It’s difficult to analyze disparate concepts

With traditional concept screening, you’re often stuck playing it safe—narrowing your concept list to a few, similar ideas. It can be difficult to screen divergent ideas and make a comparative analysis.

Explore a broad test set to determine which ideas will create greater customer loyalty and revenue potential

With our prediction markets, you don’t have to limit yourself to one variable. You can efficiently compare the success potential of many concepts, gaining clear and accurate data to make smarter decisions.



[Image]

Concept optimization
How can you improve an idea?

How do you transform a good idea into a successful idea, raising its appeal and revenue potential? How do you change an underperforming product into a true winner?

Strengthen an idea’s appeal and revenue potential early in development

Our prediction markets give you much more than rank order. Leveraging the wisdom of the crowd, you also gain tangible ideas to optimize your concepts. It’s about taking good ideas and making them even better.

International screening

International screening can be time consuming and expensive

If you’re developing products for international markets, you know it can be a financial and logistical headache to recruit target audiences and screen concepts across borders.

Save time and money screening concepts globally, without compromising on accuracy

Because our prediction markets are conducted online with a general population, they’re a powerful way to screen concepts across cultures. Your market simply needs to understand two premises: (1) investing in a good idea and (2) earning a reward.

Prediction Markets for Brand Positioning & Creative

Make Smarter Decisions with Richer Data

	Challenge with Most Screening:	Solution with Intengo:


Image?


Net attraction scores


You don’t know the polarity of each idea, making your business vulnerable

With traditional, top two box scores and mean scores, it can be difficult to determine which concepts have the most positive (or negative) energy. If you don’t know which concepts are the most polarizing, how do you know you won’t get burned at launch?

Use richer data to clearly find the best ideas

With our prediction markets, you receive a net attraction score, in addition to a clear rank order. We look at the extremes in people’s preferences, so you can easily understand the relative strengths between concepts and where to focus your resources.

Not to mention, identifying the highly polarizing concepts can create interesting opportunities for further development.



Image?


Emotional drivers


Are you unintentionally evoking the wrong emotions?

Do you know how your brand positioning or creative will connect with people on an emotional level? Will it make the impression you want? Are you triggering enough of the right emotions? Or worse... are you sparking the wrong emotions?

Strengthen the impact of your creative and minimize unexpected reactions

Our prediction markets have participants evaluate your concepts using a series of emotional drivers. You’ll gain a clear understanding of which emotions your concepts are evoking and valuable input on how to enhance (or avoid) those emotions.




Image?

Actionable market input


To save time or money, you have to sacrifice the quality of feedback

Want results quickly or affordably? If yes, you often have to sacrifice the accuracy or depth of data you receive.
Gather rich market feedback to fine tune your ideas and drive desired emotions

Levering the wisdom of the crowd, you receive rich, qualitative input without compromising on speed. We can explore why a concept resonated (or didn’t resonate), collect and rank ideas to drive stronger emotion, and gather other market input.

Methodology
Who Says You Can’t Predict People?

Our progressive approach to concept screening was inspired by the New York Times business bestseller, “The Wisdom of Crowds.” The idea is that under the right circumstances, a large group of everyday people can better predict outcomes than a small group of experts.

When it comes to human behavior, we often aren’t the best predictors of our own behavior. We have a tendency to overstate our intentions. Yet, when we ask a large group of people how they think we’ll behave (and we incent them to choose correctly), they can be extremely accurate in predicting our behavior.

With this in mind, our prediction markets evaluate how successful your concepts will be using a diverse population of people, rather than a target audience. We ask participants to self-select in based on their knowledge of your topic area, and we incent them to make an accurate prediction.

This is a sophisticated form of crowdsourcing, and it’s been around for 100+ years.

Premise | How It Works | A Pure Approach | Recruiting Participants | Confidentiality

How It Works: An Online Stock Market

Imagine a virtual, online stock market. Participants, known as “traders,” are given virtual dollars to buy shares in your product ideas or branding and advertising ideas. Like a real world stock market, the prices for concepts fluctuate, depending on whether people believe a concept is of value or not.

It’s important to note, we don’t ask traders, what would you do? We ask them, what do you believe the target audience will do—and why?

By observing how share prices move over several days, we can make highly accurate predictions regarding the real world success of the concepts you’re screening.

With our fresh approach, concept screening is fun, and traders have a personal stake in it. They get a small financial reward based on their performance, rather than just for participating. Our approach creates high engagement, which leads to richer diagnostics and more candid feedback on your concepts.

Premise | How It Works | A Pure Approach | Recruiting Participants | Confidentiality

A Pure Approach = High Accuracy

Our unique methodology is a pure approach for conducting a prediction market, and we have a U.S. patent for it. There are two essential elements that make our markets highly accurate:

•	We gather input from a diverse population of people.
•	The population is incented to predict accurately. They feel “gain” in a win or “pain” in a loss.

Our approach is based on hundreds of hours of research on prediction markets. It builds on best practices from a variety of fields and markets, including the:

•	New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), an advanced prediction market with a diverse set of traders.
•	Iowa Electronic Markets (IEMs), which are used to predict political elections. The IEMs have been more accurate in predicting election outcomes than polls 75% of the time.
•	Hollywood Stock Exchange (HSE), which allows people to wager on box-office returns and the Oscars. It’s considered one of the best forecasts of weekend box office results and Oscar results.

We took inspiration from these markets—as well as many others—and transformed them into our innovative and patented approach.

How We Recruit Your Participants

Dreaming about more efficient ways to recruit participants?

We collaborate with top survey panel providers to recruit your participants. We focus on a statistically valid sample of “general population” consumers to participate in your prediction market.

Keep in mind, not everyone who is recruited participates in your prediction market. People self-select into your concept screen based on their familiarity with the topic area and their belief they can make an accurate—and winning—prediction.

This is one of the main reasons that prediction markets are accurate, even with a diverse population. Nobody likes to lose money: real or imaginary!

If you wish to include your own customers or employees, we can do that too.

Keeping Your Big Ideas Confidential

Our clients tend to be creative thinkers, and it’s extremely important to us to protect the confidentiality of all their ideas.

We have a variety of security measures in place to safeguard your concepts, including a:

•	Digital Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA): All participants must sign a digital NDA. It legally prohibits them from sharing the concepts they see with any third party.

•	Download Prevention: We have technical measures in place to prevent participants from downloading or copying any concept images or descriptions. Attempts to do so result in immediate termination from the study.

•	Digital Watermark: All concept images are imprinted with a digital watermark, unique to each participant. These watermarks that would allow us to trace any shared images back to a specific participant.

Case Study

A Tale of Two Concept Screens... for Just for Men®

Combe is a leading maker of personal care products—from Just for Men® hair care products to Odor Eaters® foot care.

Like many companies, Combe had some frustrations with traditional concept screening methods. Given how personal many of their products are, it was time consuming and expensive to engage their target markets and screen diverse product ideas. At times, finding the right niche to screen products was like looking for a needle in a haystack!

Core challenge:  Time consuming and expensive to conduct traditional product screening

Two Different Paths to Screening the Same Ideas

Intengo agreed to conduct a prediction market of Just for Men® product concepts alongside one of Combe’s traditional concept screening methods, so the company could compare the results of the two approaches.

[Jeff, please turn the table below into an infographic.]

Methodology:	Incidence survey (conventional mall intercept)
	Prediction market
Participants:	Screened for target population of product users and health issue sufferers	Recruited statistically valid sample of “general population” consumers
Participants self-selected into the concept screen

Incidence rate:	7%	Not applicable

Sample size:
	≈ 250 people	≈ 200 people
Participant demographics:	Older and male:
40% under age 45
50% male / 50% female	Younger and female:
56% under age 40
38% male / 62% female

Approach	Survey questions to identify top 3 concepts	Online stock market that included a control concept to gauge concept strength

 
An Inside Look at the Prediction Market

Each prediction market participant (“trader”) was given $1,000 virtual dollars and asked, “What are the chances of each Just for Men® concept being most popular among consumers?”

As with any true stock market, traders were able to see what other traders thought.

As traders weighed in, the stock prices began to fluctuate away from their starting prices of $25/share. The concepts separated, and one of the new concepts increased from $25 to $36/share (well above the control concept’s stock price), while the other concepts declined.

In addition to a clear rank order, traders shared open-ended comments to explain why they had made their choices and provided input on how to improve the concepts.

The Big Picture: How Did the Concept Screens Compare?

[Prominent callout box:]

Randy Berkowitz
Vice President of Global Market Research

“The prediction market gave us the answer in one week, compared to four weeks for the 7% incidence survey that cost twice as much.”


•	Accuracy: The prediction market successfully predicted the most preferred concept and the same directional rank order as the incidence survey, with minor exceptions.

•	Speed: The prediction market itself was completed in less than two days, while the overall process took place in one week—one-quarter of the time of the incidence survey.

•	Participant engagement: Combe was impressed with the trader engagement level in the prediction market. More than 70% of the traders described the process using words such as: “fun,” “interesting,” “cool,” and “love it.”

•	Investment. Combe estimates that using prediction markets as a substitute for traditional methods will cut their concept screening costs by at least 50%.
