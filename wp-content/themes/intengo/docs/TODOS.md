Hey Kyle,
I had a chance to get my thoughts together. My comments are in sticky notes in the attached PDF.
I know Paul won't be able to get to all of these issues...but figured I should provide them all.
My biggest concerns in order of importance are:
When clicking on sub sections, the pages need to VISIBLY scroll to that section...otherwise the whole scrolling nav concept doesn't make sense. Even if you click from one section to a subsection of another page, it should first land on the top of the new page and scroll to the chosen subsection. (FYI, none of the subsection links are working in Safari...it only goes to the top of the page - and the user must scroll to view any further content).
The submenu items need hover states. Otherwise it's hard to understand that they are subsections.
We discussed at Jakes how the sub sections are linking too low...they should link to the top of the image above the content.
The reason I think these are the most important items are because we're using a non-traditional scrolling navigation, and these three items are necessary to ground the users in the overall structure of the site. Otherwise, they're going be pretty confused.

Let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks.
Jeff
